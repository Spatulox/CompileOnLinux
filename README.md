# CompileOnLinux

Right now, this repo is only for one of my projet : `MyGesClient`.
Later it will be a GO desktop app which will be able to build different packages (deb, rpm, AppImage, flatpak) with one graphical interface.

## Bash script

All release will be in the `builds` folder

To add an icon :
- Create a folder `icons` and name the icon "appicon.png"

"Copy - Paste" the binary file (executable file) in the root folder (same as the README.md) (only work with the "MyGesClient" name lol)
